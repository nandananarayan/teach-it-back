# teach-it-back
An interactive learning web app where users explain a topic out loud while the system transcribes speech in real time and intelligently interrupts with context-aware questions based on the chosen topic (DSA, OS, etc.), helping reinforce understanding through active recall and teaching.

🚧 Status: In Progress  
I am actively working on this project and will keep updating it.

Current features:
- Basic layout
- Styling with CSS
- JavaScript functionality (ongoing)
